# Tourist-Application
The purpose of the application “Tourist Assist” is to guide the tourist with regard to the tourist spots in a city. This application allows the user to locate the nearby attractions based on the category the user selects. This cat- egory includes many options such as Gardens, Golf Courses, Mosques, Museums, Parks, Airports, etc. This ap- plication will also let the user pick a place based on the reviews, locate the route (Via Google Maps) and also make reservations in any hotel across the city if required ( Via Expedia ). The user also has an option to rate a place and give feedbacks.
